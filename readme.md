# dkmusic :: the ultimate mp3 music library manager.
**dkmusic** is the ultimate mp3 music library manager built on the PHP framework Laravel. It is intended to organize your mp3 music collection by preventing duplicates.

## How does it work?

### Import
Simply put your music files into the inbox folder.
**dkmusic** will analyze your files and move non-mp3 files into an internal folder for later conversion.
If an mp3 files does not have a proper ID3Tag V2.3 (at least title and artist are required), it will moved it into a separate folder. 

Your music files will be organized in the corresponding folders (#, A-Z) of your music library (sorted by first letter of artist).
Duplicates will be removed according to their acoustid and audio fingerprint.
For more information about acoustid and audio fingerprints visit www.acoustid.org.

**The following steps are performed:**
- Remove punctuation marks, apostrophes, curly and square brackets from artist and title
- Remove "The" and "Die" from beginning of artist
- Replace german umlauts, accents, and special characters.
- Convert "featuring" and "feat" to "ft"
- Convert artist and title to lowercase except first letter
- Rename filename accordingly (a timestamp is added if filename already exists)

**Afterwards your music files will look like this:**
- Phil collins - In the air tonight (radio edit).mp3
- Flo rida ft akon - Who dat girl (mds dont know who she is remix).mp3
- Howard carpendale - Nachts wenn alles schlaeft.mp3
- Black eyed peas - Dont stop the party.mp3

**Note:** Since the external library getID3 does not support ID3-tag writing of m4a files,
all your m4a files must to be converted to mp3.


## Requirements
In order to use dkmusic you need to have the following server environment:
- PHP 5.4 or later
- MySQL Database 5.1 or later

Either store your Music in the public folder called Music or make a symbolic link to the location of your music library.
The folder structure **must be** # and folders from A to Z.

**Note:** **dkmusic** works best in a local server environment on your desktop computer, since the database requires a lot of ressources, especially if your music library is very big (>100.000 files).

**Note:** Since **dkmusic** is still in development, some features are not implemented yet.
