{"name":"dkmusic","tagline":"the ultimate mp3 music library manager","body":"# dkmusic :: the ultimate mp3 music library manager.\r\n**dkmusic** is the ultimate mp3 music library manager built on the PHP framework Laravel. It is intended to organize your mp3 music collection by preventing duplicates.\r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\n\r\n### Import\r\nSimply put your music files into the inbox folder.\r\n**dkmusic** will analyze your files and move non-mp3 files into an internal folder for later conversion.\r\nIf an mp3 files does not have a proper ID3Tag V2.3 (at least title and artist are required), it will moved it into a separate folder. \r\n\r\nYour music files will be organized in the corresponding folders (#, A-Z) of your music library (sorted by first letter of artist).\r\nDuplicates will be removed according to their acoustid and audio fingerprint.\r\nFor more information about acoustid and audio fingerprints visit www.acoustid.org.\r\n\r\n**The following steps are performed:**\r\n- Remove punctuation marks, apostrophes, curly and square brackets from artist and title\r\n- Remove \"The\" and \"Die\" from beginning of artist\r\n- Replace german umlauts, accents, and special characters.\r\n- Convert \"featuring\" and \"feat\" to \"ft\"\r\n- Convert artist and title to lowercase except first letter\r\n- Rename filename accordingly (a timestamp is added if filename already exists)\r\n\r\n**Afterwards your music files will look like this:**\r\n- Phil collins - In the air tonight (radio edit).mp3\r\n- Flo rida ft akon - Who dat girl (mds dont know who she is remix).mp3\r\n- Howard carpendale - Nachts wenn alles schlaeft.mp3\r\n- Black eyed peas - Dont stop the party.mp3\r\n\r\n**Note:** Since the external library getID3 does not support ID3-tag writing of m4a files,\r\nall your m4a files must to be converted to mp3.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nIn order to use dkmusic you need to have the following server environment:\r\n- PHP 5.4 or later\r\n- MySQL Database 5.1 or later\r\n\r\nEither store your Music in the public folder called Music or make a symbolic link to the location of your music library.\r\nThe folder structure **must be** # and folders from A to Z.\r\n\r\n**Note:** **dkmusic** works best in a local server environment on your desktop computer, since the database requires a lot of ressources, especially if your music library is very big (>100.000 files).\r\n\r\n**Note:** Since **dkmusic** is still in development, some features are not implemented yet.\r\n\r\n## Contributing to dkmusic\r\nContributions are encouraged and welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\nTo all the beta testers!
